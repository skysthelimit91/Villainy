# Villainy
These characters have committed horrible crimes. Lock them up!

As a user, I want to be able to punish those who have gotten away with wrong doing for too long. I want to accomplish this by jailing these criminals in a prison of my choosing. I want my prisons to be separate from those of other users. I also want to be able to view some brief info on these villains, as well as free them if I feel they have been punished enough.
